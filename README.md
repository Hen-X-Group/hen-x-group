Hen-X-Group — One-page static site

Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- scripts.js
- thank-you.html
- Logo.png, Logo transparent.png, image3.jpeg, image4.jpg, image5.jpeg

Deployment (manual upload to Netlify):
1. Zip the folder contents or create a repo.
2. On Netlify, create a new site and drag & drop the site folder (or connect repo) — set the publish directory to the root.
3. Netlify forms are enabled by the included form markup; test by submitting the form and checking Netlify "Forms".

Notes:
- I used `image4.jpg` from the workspace as the hero. You wrote `image4.png` earlier — if you intended a PNG, please provide it or tell me to switch to `image4.png`.
- Colors are currently a fallback in CSS. If you'd like the exact colors pulled from `Logo.png`, I can extract and apply them.
- If you want analytics, sitemap, or robots.txt, tell me and I'll add them.
